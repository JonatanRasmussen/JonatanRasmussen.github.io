## DTU Course Browser

*DTU Course Browser* I webscrabed all public course data at my university (DTU) and gathered all of it [on a single website](https://dtucourseanalyzer.pythonanywhere.com/) for anyone to browse. My website also offers more in-depth search filters than the official DTU websites as well as evaluation summaries and overviews.
