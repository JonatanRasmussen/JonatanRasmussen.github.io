Most of my hobby projects are publicly available on github! The following list is some of my best projects:

### Highlights

## DTU Course Browser

Link: <https://github.com/JonatanRasmussen/dtu-course-browser>

*DTU Course Browser* I webscrabed all public course data at my university (DTU) and gathered all of it [on a single website](https://dtucourseanalyzer.pythonanywhere.com/) for anyone to browse. My website also offers more in-depth search filters than the official DTU websites as well as evaluation summaries and overviews.
