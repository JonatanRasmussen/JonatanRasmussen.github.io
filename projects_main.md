# Noteworthy projects

The following is a highlight of my best projects, fully released to the public *and used by thousands of people.*

**DTU Course Browser website**: A highly popular course analysis tool for DTU. I webscrabed all public DTU course data and put it on a website, giving students access to search filters and grade/evaluation statistics that are otherwise unavailable on the official DTU website.

- [Github repository](https://github.com/JonatanRasmussen) | [Live website](https://dtucourseanalyzer.pythonanywhere.com/)
- *The site receives daily traffic and is kind of a big deal – as of April 2025, [my website announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU/comments/1eb9rgv/im_launching_my_dtu_course_analyzer_website_a/) is the [top post of all-time](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU/top/?sort=top&t=all) on reddit.com/r/DTU (a forum with daily submissions, created in 2011).*
- *The site receives 100.000+ page hits per month, however this is misleading since 1 site visit creates several hundreds of page hits.*

**WoW /say Callouts M+**: A World of Warcraft game interface addon with 1100+ downloads. I am the original author and current maintainer of World of Warcraft custom mod */say Callouts M+* which uses the WeakAuras framework to alert players about dangerous `combat_log_events`.

- [Link to Weakaura page](https://wago.io/6CDe7U7t6)
- *As of April 2025, it has [over 12000 views, 1100 downloads and 150 stars](https://wago.io/6CDe7U7t6). I update it twice a year to support the newest gameplay content.*

**YouTube channel**: A handful of personal videos about DTU and about life. 300+ subscribers and 500 to 10.000 views per video, including a DTU "review" [Min oplevelse på DTU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lt1gV3O6F7o) with 9000 views.

- I use numbers and popularity metrics as quick social proof, not because I obsess over it. If you have the time, check out each project yourself.
