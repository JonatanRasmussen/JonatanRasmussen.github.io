## DTU Course Browser website
<div class="grid" markdown>
<div class="grid-item" markdown>

[Github repository](https://github.com/JonatanRasmussen) | [Live website](https://dtucourseanalyzer.pythonanywhere.com/)

I webscrabed all public course data at my university (DTU) and gathered all of it on a single website for anyone to browse. My website also offers more in-depth search filters than the official DTU websites as well as evaluation summaries and overviews.

This hobby project has been independently developed in my spare time and has not been part of any DTU course.

*As of January 2025, [my announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU/comments/1eb9rgv/im_launching_my_dtu_course_analyzer_website_a/) for my 'DTU Course Analyzer' website is the [top post of all-time](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU/top/?sort=top&t=all) on reddit.com/r/DTU, with the site maintaining consistent user engagement since launch.*

## World of Warcraft interface addon */say Callouts M+*
<div class="grid" markdown>
<div class="grid-item" markdown>

[Link to Weakaura page](https://wago.io/6CDe7U7t6)

I am the author and current maintainer of World of Warcraft custom mod */say Callouts M+*. It uses the WeakAuras framework to alert players about dangerous `combat_log_events`.

*As of January 2025, it has [over 12000 views, 1100 downloads and 150 stars](https://wago.io/6CDe7U7t6). I update it twice a year to support the newest gameplay content.*
