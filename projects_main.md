# Highlighted projects

Most of my projects are publicly available on [my Github profile](https://github.com/JonatanRasmussen)! The following is a highlight of my best projects:

## DTU Course Browser

[Github repository](https://github.com/JonatanRasmussen/dtu-course-browser)

[Link to website](https://dtucourseanalyzer.pythonanywhere.com/)

I webscrabed all public course data at my university (DTU) and gathered all of it on a single website for anyone to browse. My website also offers more in-depth search filters than the official DTU websites as well as evaluation summaries and overviews.

*As of January 2025, [my announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU/comments/1eb9rgv/im_launching_my_dtu_course_analyzer_website_a/) for 'DTU Course Analyzer' website is the [top post of all-time](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU/top/?sort=top&t=all) on reddit.com/r/DTU*
