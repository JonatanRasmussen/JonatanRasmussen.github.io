# Highlighted Projects

Github profile: <https://github.com/JonatanRasmussen>

Most of my hobby projects are publicly available on github! The following list is a highlight of some of my best projects:

## DTU Course Browser

Link: <https://github.com/JonatanRasmussen/dtu-course-browser>

*As of January 2025, my 'DTU Course Analyzer' website is the [top post of all-time](https://www.reddit.com/r/DTU/top/?sort=top&t=all) on reddit.com/r/DTU*

I webscrabed all public course data at my university (DTU) and gathered all of it [on a single website](https://dtucourseanalyzer.pythonanywhere.com/) for anyone to browse. My website also offers more in-depth search filters than the official DTU websites as well as evaluation summaries and overviews.
